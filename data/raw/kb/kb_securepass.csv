1,General,What is SecurePass SSO?,SecurePass SSO lets employees sign in once with their company account and then access all connected applications without entering their password again.,"general,sso,overview"
2,General,How does SecurePass SSO work in simple terms?,"SecurePass redirects you to your organization's identity provider when you log in. After you authenticate there, SecurePass uses that session to sign you in to other apps automatically.","general,sso,overview"
3,General,Do I still need a separate password for each application?,"No. You sign in with your company account in SecurePass, and the connected applications trust that sign-in. You still must protect your company password and MFA carefully.","general,password,sso"
4,Account & Login,Where do I go to log in to SecurePass?,"Open your browser and go to your organization's SecurePass portal URL, for example https://login.securepass.example.com, and sign in with your company email and password.","login,portal,url"
5,Account & Login,What username should I use to sign in?,"Use the same company email address you use for other internal systems, such as your corporate email or HR portal. If you are unsure, contact your local IT or helpdesk.","login,username,identity"
6,Account & Login,I forgot my password. How can I reset it?,"On the SecurePass sign-in page, click 'Forgot password'. Enter your company email and follow the instructions. In most organizations the reset link is sent to your email or SMS.","login,password,reset"
7,Account & Login,I see 'Your account is locked'. What should I do?,"Your account may be locked after too many failed login attempts or a security policy. Wait a few minutes and try again. If the message persists, contact your helpdesk to unlock the account.","login,lockout,security"
8,Account & Login,I never received the password reset email. Why?,"First, check your spam folder. Ensure you typed the correct email address. Some organizations block external emails, so the reset might be sent only to your corporate mailbox, not a personal one.","login,password,email"
9,MFA,What is multi-factor authentication (MFA) in SecurePass?,"MFA adds a second step to your login, such as a code from an app, SMS, or a hardware token. It protects your account even if someone knows your password.","mfa,security,overview"
10,MFA,How do I enable MFA for my SecurePass account?,"Sign in to SecurePass, open your profile or security settings, and choose 'Set up multi-factor authentication'. Follow the wizard to register an authenticator app or another factor allowed by your organization.","mfa,setup,security"
11,MFA,Which MFA methods does SecurePass support?,"Typical options include TOTP authenticator apps, push notifications, SMS codes, hardware security keys, and backup recovery codes. The exact list depends on your organization's security policy.","mfa,methods,security"
12,MFA,I changed my phone and lost access to my MFA app. What now?,"If you still have access to backup codes, use one of them to sign in and re-register MFA. If not, contact your helpdesk to verify your identity and reset MFA on your account.","mfa,device,reset"
13,MFA,Can I disable MFA on my account?,"In most organizations you cannot disable MFA yourself. MFA is enforced by security policy. If you have issues with a particular factor, ask the helpdesk to switch you to another supported method.","mfa,policy,security"
14,Devices & Sessions,Why does SecurePass log me out after a while?,"Your organization defines session lifetime policies. After some idle time or a fixed duration, SecurePass ends the session for security reasons and you must sign in again.","session,timeout,security"
15,Devices & Sessions,Can I stay signed in on my personal device?,"If allowed by policy, you may tick 'Remember this device' or 'Keep me signed in'. Do this only on trusted devices you control, never on public or shared computers.","session,remember,device"
16,Devices & Sessions,How do I sign out of all devices?,"Go to your SecurePass profile, open the sessions or devices section, and choose 'Sign out of all sessions'. This is recommended if you suspect your account was used on an unknown device.","session,logout,security"
17,Troubleshooting,I enter correct credentials but keep seeing 'Access denied'. What should I check?,"Verify that you are using the correct portal URL and company email. The application you are trying to open may not be assigned to you. If the issue persists, contact the helpdesk with a screenshot and timestamp.","error,access-denied,permissions"
18,Troubleshooting,"SSO was working yesterday, but now I am always asked to log in again. Why?","Your login session may have expired, cookies may be disabled, or your browser is clearing cookies on close. Enable cookies for the SecurePass domain and check that you are not using private browsing mode permanently.","error,sso,session"
19,Troubleshooting,I see a blank page or endless redirect after login. What can I do?,"Try another browser, clear cookies for the SecurePass domain, and disable browser extensions that block scripts. If the problem remains, send the URL and time of the error to the helpdesk.","error,redirect,browser"
20,Troubleshooting,I cannot access a specific application from SecurePass. Others work fine.,The application might not be assigned to your account or may be temporarily unavailable. Contact the application owner or helpdesk and provide the app name and the error message you see.,"error,application,access"
21,Security & Privacy,Does SecurePass store my application passwords?,"SecurePass primarily relies on modern federation protocols (SAML, OIDC). In that case it does not store your application passwords but uses secure tokens issued by your identity provider.","security,passwords,saml,oidc"
22,Security & Privacy,Who can see my login activity in SecurePass?,"Administrators and security teams can see metadata such as login time, IP address, device type, and success or failure, but not your password or MFA codes.","security,privacy,logs"

25,Admin & Setup,How long does it normally take to set up SSO for a new application?,"For standard SAML or OIDC apps, setup typically takes from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on testing and approvals. Custom or legacy apps may require additional configuration and coordination with the vendor.","admin,sso,setup"
26,Admin & Setup,Who in my organization can request SSO integration for a new app?,"Usually application owners, team leads, or IT admins can request an SSO integration. End users should contact their manager or helpdesk and provide the app name and business justification.","admin,request,governance"
27,Admin & Setup,Does enabling SSO cost extra for my team?,"Within one organization, SSO is usually part of your existing SecurePass subscription. Some third-party vendors may charge separately for SSO support, so check the contract for that application.","admin,cost,licensing"
28,Admin & Setup,Can SecurePass create user accounts automatically in connected apps?,"If supported, administrators can enable just-in-time provisioning or SCIM. This allows SecurePass to create user accounts in the target application on first login or keep them in sync automatically.","admin,provisioning,scim"
29,Admin & Setup,Can we restrict access to SecurePass from specific countries or IP ranges?,"Yes, administrators can define network security policies that allow or block logins based on IP ranges, locations, or VPN requirements. Ask your security team to configure these policies.","admin,network,policy"
30,Admin & Setup,How can I get audit logs for logins through SecurePass?,"Organization admins can export audit logs from the SecurePass admin console. Logs include login attempts, device information, IP addresses, and changes to security settings.","admin,audit,logs"
31,General,Why do I sometimes see the SecurePass page in a different language?,"SecurePass can detect your browser language and your organization’s preferred language. If they differ, the interface might switch automatically. You can change language in the profile settings if your admin allowed it.","general,language,ui"
32,General,Can I use SecurePass with multiple organizations at the same time?,"SecurePass is typically configured per organization. If you work for multiple organizations, you may receive separate invitations and portal URLs for each one and must choose the correct portal before signing in.","general,multi-tenant,organizations"
33,General,Does SecurePass work in all browsers?,"SecurePass supports modern browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. Old or unsupported browsers may cause issues with redirects, cookies, or security features. Always keep your browser up to date.","general,browser,support"
34,General,Can I access SecurePass from my mobile phone?,"Yes. You can open the SecurePass portal in a mobile browser, and many organizations also provide a mobile app or link SecurePass into their existing company app. Check your internal documentation for details.","general,mobile,access"
35,General,Why do I see a warning that my browser is not supported?,"Your browser version may be too old or use experimental features that are not tested. Update to the latest stable version, or switch to a supported browser such as Chrome or Edge.","general,browser,warning"
36,Account & Login,Why am I asked to confirm my email address when I first sign in?,Some organizations require email verification to ensure that the account really belongs to you. Follow the link in the verification email and then return to the SecurePass portal.,"login,email,verification"
37,Account & Login,Can I change the email address I use for SecurePass?,"In most organizations, your login email is managed centrally in the directory and cannot be changed from SecurePass. Ask HR or IT to update your primary email if it has changed.","login,email,account"
38,Account & Login,What should I do if I see 'Your account is disabled'?,"Your account may have been deactivated due to role changes, leave, or a security incident. Contact your manager or the helpdesk to understand the reason and, if needed, request reactivation.","login,disabled,account"
39,Account & Login,Why do I see 'Your account is not assigned to this application'?,"You successfully logged in to SecurePass, but the specific application is not assigned to your user or group. Contact the app owner or helpdesk to request access and include the app name in your request.","login,access,applications"
40,Account & Login,Can I use a personal email to sign in to SecurePass?,Usually no. SecurePass is designed for corporate or institutional accounts. You should use your official company or university email address.,"login,personal-email,policy"
41,MFA,Why did SecurePass suddenly start asking for MFA on every login?,"Your organization might have tightened security policies, for example after an incident or audit. The policy can require MFA on each login or from untrusted networks. Ask your security team if this change is permanent.","mfa,policy,frequency"
42,MFA,What is a backup recovery code and how should I store it?,"A backup recovery code is a one-time code that allows you to sign in if you lose your main MFA device. Store it offline in a safe place (for example a password manager or printed copy), never in plain text on your desktop.","mfa,recovery,backup"
43,MFA,Why do I not see SMS as an MFA option?,"Your organization may have disabled SMS for security or cost reasons. In that case you must use one of the allowed methods such as an authenticator app, push notification, or hardware key.","mfa,sms,policy"
44,MFA,Can I register more than one MFA method?,"Yes, in most setups you can register multiple factors, such as an authenticator app and a hardware key. This is recommended to avoid losing access when a single device fails.","mfa,devices,multiple"
45,MFA,What is step-up MFA in SecurePass?,"Step-up MFA means that SecurePass can request an additional MFA challenge when you access sensitive applications or perform critical actions, even if you already have an active session.","mfa,step-up,security"
46,MFA,Why does MFA sometimes not prompt me on familiar devices?,"Your organization may use risk-based or remembered-device policies. If SecurePass considers the device low risk and recently verified, it may skip additional prompts for a limited time.","mfa,remembered-device,risk"
47,Devices & Sessions,Why do I see my previous device still listed as active?,"Sometimes it takes a short time for session information to sync or expire. If you no longer use a device, you can explicitly sign out all sessions from your SecurePass profile.","session,devices,active"
48,Devices & Sessions,Is it safe to use SecurePass on public Wi-Fi?,"You should avoid using corporate accounts on untrusted networks. If you must, use a company VPN, keep your device updated, and never save your password in the browser on shared or public machines.","session,security,network"
49,Devices & Sessions,What does 'untrusted device' mean in SecurePass?,"SecurePass and your organization may label devices as untrusted if they are new, unmanaged, or missing security checks. Access from such devices may require extra MFA or may be blocked by policy.","session,device-trust,policy"
50,Devices & Sessions,Why did SecurePass ask me to re-approve this browser after an update?,Major browser updates or clearing cookies can cause SecurePass to treat it as a new browser. You may be asked to re-authenticate or re-approve the device for security reasons.,"session,browser-update,cookies"
51,Devices & Sessions,Can I see from which locations my account was used?,"If enabled, the SecurePass profile or your organization's security portal can show recent sign-ins with approximate location, IP address, and device type. Ask your security team if you cannot find this information.","session,location,logs"
52,Applications & Access,How do I see all applications available to me in SecurePass?,"After signing in, open the 'Applications' or 'Dashboard' page. It lists all apps assigned to your user or groups. If something is missing, contact the app owner or helpdesk.","applications,access,dashboard"
53,Applications & Access,Why do I see an application tile but cannot open it?,"The tile may be visible to everyone but the app enforces additional, app-level permissions. Contact the app owner to confirm that your account is allowed to access the service.","applications,permissions,error"
54,Applications & Access,How can I request access to a new application through SecurePass?,"Some organizations provide a 'Request access' link on the app tile or in the catalog. Otherwise contact your manager or helpdesk and include the app name, reason for access, and urgency.","applications,request,workflow"
55,Applications & Access,What happens when an application is removed from SecurePass?,"The tile disappears from your dashboard, and SSO to that app no longer works. Your data in the application may still exist; check with the app owner about data retention or alternative access methods.","applications,removal,lifecycle"
56,Applications & Access,Why does my role inside an application not match my job title?,"SecurePass controls authentication, but roles inside the application may be managed by the application itself or by groups in the directory. Contact the app owner to review your role mapping.","applications,roles,groups"
57,Applications & Access,Can I favorite or pin frequently used apps?,Many SecurePass portals allow you to mark some apps as favorites or pin them to the top of the dashboard. Look for a star icon or 'Add to favorites' action on the app tile.,"applications,favorites,usability"
58,Browser & Extensions,Do I need a browser extension to use SecurePass?,In most modern SSO setups you do not need an extension; everything works via redirects. A browser extension might be required only for legacy apps that use password vaulting or form filling.,"browser,extension,legacy"
59,Browser & Extensions,SecurePass asks me to enable pop-ups. Is this safe?,"Some login flows open new windows or tabs for authentication. Allow pop-ups only for the SecurePass and identity provider domains, not for all sites.","browser,popups,security"
60,Browser & Extensions,Why does my ad-blocker break the SecurePass login page?,Some content blockers may block scripts or iframes used in the sign-in flow. Temporarily disable the extension or whitelist the SecurePass and identity provider domains.,"browser,adblock,errors"
61,Browser & Extensions,Should I save my SecurePass password in the browser password manager?,"This depends on your organization's policy. Many security teams recommend using a dedicated password manager rather than built-in browser storage, especially on shared or unmanaged devices.","browser,password-manager,policy"
62,Mobile & Desktop App,Is there a dedicated SecurePass mobile app?,"Some organizations deploy SecurePass as a dedicated app, while others rely on the browser only. Check your internal documentation or app catalog for 'SecurePass' or 'SSO portal'.","mobile,app,portal"
63,Mobile & Desktop App,Why does the SecurePass mobile site look different from the desktop version?,The mobile site is optimized for small screens and touch input. Some features may be grouped in menus instead of visible on the main page but should still be accessible.,"mobile,ui,responsive"
64,Mobile & Desktop App,Can I receive push MFA prompts on mobile when logging in from my laptop?,"Yes. If you enrolled a push-capable authenticator app on your phone, SecurePass can send MFA prompts there when you sign in on another device.","mobile,mfa,push"
65,Mobile & Desktop App,How do I log out of SecurePass in the mobile browser?,"Open the menu icon in the mobile portal and choose 'Sign out' or 'Log out'. Close the browser tab afterwards, especially on shared devices.","mobile,logout,security"
66,Mobile & Desktop App,Why do I keep being redirected to the desktop version on my tablet?,Some tablets identify as desktop browsers. Try enabling 'Request mobile site' in your browser or use the dedicated mobile app if available.,"mobile,tablet,redirect"
67,Troubleshooting,I see 'Clock skew' or 'Your computer time is incorrect' during login.,"SecurePass relies on accurate system time for security tokens. If your device time differs from internet time by several minutes, login may fail. Enable automatic time sync on your device and try again.","troubleshooting,time,clock-skew"
68,Troubleshooting,Why does login work in one browser but fail in another?,"Different browsers may have different cookie, extension, or privacy settings. Compare extensions, clear cookies for the SecurePass domain in the failing browser, and ensure that third-party cookies are not completely blocked.","troubleshooting,browser,comparison"
69,Troubleshooting,What information should I include when opening a ticket with the helpdesk?,"Provide the time of the issue, your username, the application you tried to open, the exact error message, and a screenshot if possible. This helps support reproduce and resolve the problem faster.","troubleshooting,helpdesk,information"
70,Troubleshooting,I get 'You are not allowed to access this resource from your network'.,"Your organization may restrict access by IP range, VPN, or country. Connect to the corporate VPN or trusted network and try again, or ask your security team to review the network policy.","troubleshooting,network,policy"
71,Troubleshooting,"Login works, but I am immediately signed out when opening an app.","This can happen if cookies or third-party cookies are blocked in your browser, or if the app uses a different domain that your browser treats separately. Allow cookies and try again or contact the helpdesk.","troubleshooting,cookies,sso"
72,Troubleshooting,Why do I see a 'loop detected' or 'too many redirects' error?,"A misconfiguration between SecurePass, the identity provider, and the application may cause redirect loops. Report the issue to the helpdesk with the full URL and the affected application name.","troubleshooting,redirect-loop,configuration"
73,Security & Privacy,Does SecurePass see the content of my emails or files?,"SecurePass focuses on authentication and access control. It typically stores identity and session metadata, not the content of your emails, documents, or messages. Content access is governed by the individual applications.","security,privacy,scope"
74,Security & Privacy,Can SecurePass block sign-ins from risky devices automatically?,"Yes, if your organization enabled risk-based policies. These can block or challenge sign-ins from devices that fail security checks, unknown locations, or suspicious behavior patterns.","security,risk,policies"
75,Security & Privacy,How often should I change my password when using SecurePass?,"Follow your organization's password policy. Some companies require periodic password changes, while others focus on strong passwords and MFA instead of frequent rotations.","security,password,policy"
76,Security & Privacy,Why do I receive security alerts about unusual sign-ins?,SecurePass or your identity provider may detect sign-ins from new locations or devices and send alerts to help you confirm whether the activity is legitimate.,"security,alerts,signins"
77,Security & Privacy,Can I see which admins have access to my account details?,"Typically, only authorized administrators and security staff can see your account metadata. You cannot usually see a list of admins, but your organization should document who has access at a policy level.","security,admins,access"
78,Admin & Setup,How do admins assign an application to a user or group?,"In the SecurePass admin console, go to the application's assignment section, select the users or groups, and save the change. The tile should appear on the users' dashboards after a short delay.","admin,assignments,groups"
79,Admin & Setup,Can we use groups from our directory to control app access?,"Yes. SecurePass can sync groups from your identity provider, and admins can use those groups to assign applications and roles, simplifying access management.","admin,groups,provisioning"
80,Admin & Setup,What is just-in-time (JIT) provisioning in SecurePass?,"With JIT provisioning, SecurePass or the application creates a user account on first successful SSO login using attributes from the identity provider, instead of pre-creating all accounts manually.","admin,jit,provisioning"
81,Admin & Setup,How do we deprovision users who leave the organization?,"Disable or remove the user in the central directory. SecurePass will block SSO and, if SCIM or deprovisioning rules are configured, connected applications can automatically deactivate the account.","admin,deprovisioning,lifecycle"
82,Admin & Setup,Can we restrict SecurePass access to managed devices only?,"Yes, by combining device management tools with SecurePass policies. For example, you can require device certificates or compliant device status before allowing login.","admin,device-compliance,policy"
83,Admin & Setup,How do I configure a new SAML application in SecurePass?,"In the admin console, create a new SAML app, upload or paste the app's metadata, set the assertion consumer URL, entity ID, and requested attributes, then download the SecurePass metadata and upload it to the app side.","admin,saml,configuration"
84,Admin & Setup,How do I configure a new OIDC application in SecurePass?,"Create a new OIDC app, define redirect URIs, choose the grant type, and configure scopes and claims. Then share the client ID, secret, and issuer URL with the application owner.","admin,oidc,configuration"
85,Admin & Setup,What are common causes of SAML 'invalid signature' errors?,"Mismatched certificates, outdated metadata, or incorrect signing settings can cause invalid signature errors. Refresh the metadata on both sides and ensure that the correct certificate is used for signing.","admin,saml,errors"
86,Admin & Setup,How can we test a new SSO integration before rolling it out?,"Create a pilot group of test users, assign the app only to them, and validate login flows, role mappings, and logout behavior before enabling it for everyone.","admin,test,pilot"
87,Notifications & Emails,Why do I receive email notifications about sign-ins?,Your organization may send login notifications for security awareness. These emails help you notice suspicious activity quickly if you see sign-ins you did not initiate.,"notifications,emails,security"
88,Notifications & Emails,Can I unsubscribe from SecurePass security notifications?,"Security notifications are usually mandatory and cannot be unsubscribed from, because they are part of your organization's security controls.","notifications,emails,policy"
89,Notifications & Emails,Why did my colleague receive an access request approval email?,"Access requests may be routed to managers, app owners, or designated approvers. If your colleague is an owner or manager of the app, they may receive approval emails for your requests.","notifications,approval,workflow"
90,Notifications & Emails,I clicked a link in a suspicious email claiming to be from SecurePass. What now?,"Immediately report the email as phishing, change your password from a trusted device, and contact your security team so they can review your account activity.","notifications,phishing,incident"
91,Reporting & Analytics,Can admins see how often an application is used through SecurePass?,"Yes. The admin console usually provides usage reports that show how many users sign in to each application and when, which helps owners understand adoption and plan licensing.","admin,reporting,usage"
92,Reporting & Analytics,Can I export login events from SecurePass to our SIEM?,"Many deployments support exporting logs via API, file exports, or direct integrations with SIEM platforms. Ask your security team or SecurePass admin about available options.","admin,logs,siem"
93,Reporting & Analytics,What is the difference between audit logs and usage reports?,"Audit logs focus on security-relevant events such as login attempts and configuration changes. Usage reports summarize how often applications are accessed and by whom, usually in aggregate form.","admin,audit,usage"
94,API & Integrations,Does SecurePass provide an API for managing users and apps?,"Yes, many SSO platforms expose REST or SCIM APIs to automate user lifecycle, app assignments, and configuration. Check your internal SecurePass API documentation for details and authentication requirements.","admin,api,automation"
95,API & Integrations,Can developers use SecurePass for authentication in custom apps?,"Yes. Developers can register their app as an OIDC or SAML client in SecurePass and use it as the identity provider, so users authenticate with the same corporate credentials and MFA.","developer,api,oidc"
96,API & Integrations,How should API tokens related to SecurePass be stored?,"API tokens must be stored securely, ideally in a secrets manager or vault, not in source code or shared documents. Rotate tokens regularly and limit their scope to the minimum required permissions.","developer,api,secrets"
97,Passwordless & Biometrics,Does SecurePass support passwordless login?,Some deployments support passwordless methods such as FIDO2 security keys or platform authenticators. Check with your security team whether passwordless options are enabled for your organization.,"passwordless,fido2,security"
98,Passwordless & Biometrics,Can I use fingerprint or Face ID to unlock my SecurePass session?,"If your device supports biometrics and you use a compatible authenticator app or browser, you may confirm MFA or passwordless login with fingerprint or face recognition, depending on policy.","passwordless,biometrics,mfa"
99,Passwordless & Biometrics,Why am I sometimes asked for a password even when passwordless is enabled?,"Passwordless policies may apply only to certain apps or scenarios. In other cases, SecurePass may still require a password, for example after a risk event or when accessing particularly sensitive resources.","passwordless,policy,risk"
100,Passwordless & Biometrics,What should I do if my security key is lost or stolen?,"Immediately report the lost key to your security team, remove it from your registered MFA methods in SecurePass if you still have access, and register a new key or alternative factor.","passwordless,security-key,incident"
